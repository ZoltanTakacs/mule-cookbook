== Features to cover in tutorial

In this tutorial we are going to  incrementally show you how to add value and simplify the connectors users interaction in Mule with the different features provided by DevKit.
We are going to start by generating a simple @Connector for a web service.

After that we will show you how to add configurable field (@Configurable) that will be used in our @Processor, and how to test it.
Then we are going to show you how to enrich the errors returned by an API and how to make sure your users don't need to handle session expirations.

As we understand more about the API being consumed, we will show you why we need to add DataSense to your connector and how it improves user experience.
Having DataSense also allow you to use our DataSense Query Language (DSQL).

Other important feature that most APIs support is the Pagination of results, as well as the Batch processing
