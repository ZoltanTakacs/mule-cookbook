== Installing my @Connector

=== Using Anypoint DevKit Plugin
Installing the connector is basically the same as installing any eclipse plugin.

To install your connector from the DevKit plugin, you just need to right click on your project folder, and select the option * Anypoint Studio > Install Or Update *.

This triggers the DevKit Maven build and generates an http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fupdate_site.htm[update site] folder.

After the update site is generated a popup automatically opens showing the task that is performed.
[[install-dialog]]

The next dialog is just to review the installation/update items, followed for some license agreement.

Hit finish and after that you will need to restart Anypoint Studio for the changes to be recognized.

NOTE: Jars are not signed during this run, so you will see a popup.

Now you can use your connector in a mule app.

=== Using the update site folder

After running from the console *mvn clean package* , you can try installing it by manually selecting the update site.

Go to *Help > Install New Software*

Click on Add and in the new dialog look for the folder and select the UpdateSite file, generated under the target folder.

You can either select the zip file named UpdateSite.zip or the folder update-site.
